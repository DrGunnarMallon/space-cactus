	<p>
		Admitably, my AI Art journey started out with writing simple sentences into MidJourney and being
		amazed by the incredible images the system produces. However, I soon grew tired of the
		"Midjourney look" and discovered, fell in love with, and fully embraced Stable Diffusion. All
		work presented here was made using a combination of my own photography, Stable Diffusion, and
		Photoshop.
